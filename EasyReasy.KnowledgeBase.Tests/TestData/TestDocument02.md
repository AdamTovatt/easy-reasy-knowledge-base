# First header
The content under the first header is so long that it will break the token limit before reaching the second header.
The second header would then in turn become a different chunk since it was read as a separate segment and could not be merged.
The text here is so long and still empty in actual content because it is just to reach the token limit.

## This is the second header
The content here should be separated from the content under the first header.
