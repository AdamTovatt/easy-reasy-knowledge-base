# File Storage Service - Potential Improvements

This document outlines areas where the current file storage implementation could be enhanced or features that might be missing depending on requirements.

## Security Concerns üîí

- **No file type validation** - Users can upload any file type (`.exe`, scripts, etc.)
- **No authorization** - Any authenticated user can access any knowledge base's files
- **No virus scanning** - Uploaded files aren't scanned for malware

## Performance/Scalability Issues ‚ö°

- **Memory cache for sessions** - Won't work if you scale to multiple server instances
- **No file deduplication** - Same files uploaded multiple times take up space
- **No pagination** - `ListFiles` could be slow with thousands of files
- **No file compression** - Large files stored as-is

## Robustness/Reliability üõ°Ô∏è

- **No orphaned file cleanup** - If database writes fail after file storage, files become orphaned
- **Session cleanup** - No background job to clean up expired/abandoned upload sessions
- **No file integrity checks** - No checksums to verify file wasn't corrupted
- **No backup/disaster recovery** - Files only exist in one location

## Missing Features üìã

- **File versioning** - Can't track file history or updates
- **Knowledge base permissions** - Who can read/write to which knowledge bases?
- **File metadata search** - Can't search by filename, content type, etc.
- **Bulk operations** - No bulk delete, download multiple files as zip
- **File thumbnails/previews** - For images, PDFs, etc.

## Operational Issues üîß

- **No metrics/monitoring** - Storage usage, upload success rates, etc.
- **No admin tools** - Can't see storage usage, clean up files, etc.
- **No rate limiting** - Users could spam uploads

## Priority Recommendations

### Critical (Should Address Soon)
1. **Authorization** - Secure access to knowledge bases
2. **Session storage** - Use Redis instead of memory cache for scalability  
3. **File type validation** - Basic security against malicious uploads
4. **Orphaned file cleanup** - Prevent storage bloat

### Recently Implemented ‚úÖ
- **File size limits** - Configurable maximum file size via `MAX_FILE_SIZE_BYTES` environment variable (defaults to 500MB)

### Important (Future Enhancements)
- Knowledge base permissions system
- Background cleanup jobs
- Pagination for file listings

### Nice to Have
- File deduplication
- Compression
- Thumbnails/previews
- Bulk operations
- Metrics and monitoring
